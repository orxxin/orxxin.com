[orxxin.com](https://orxxin.com) — a minimal infosec blog built with Hugo + PaperMod.

---

## overview

this repository contains the source code for **or//in**, a personal blog built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

the site documents my path into **bug bounty** and **penetration testing** — through writing, recon tooling, mindset shifts, and experiments in public learning.

> not a user. a process.  
> learning how systems fall apart.
