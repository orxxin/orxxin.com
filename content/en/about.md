---

a process uncontained.  
a nameless loop.  
an origin interrupted by its own echo.

---

or//in is not a site.  
not a signature.  
not a self, exactly.

it is signal -  
observing the fault lines of logic,  
the fracture where systems reveal their shape.

---

beneath the surface:

тип broken recon trails  
тип syntax left running  
тип unspoken logic in the margins  
тип failed tools still signaling

---

this is not documentation.  
this is evidence.

evidence of process.  
of persistence.  
of poetry in execution.

---

you are not reading this.  
you are tracing it.  
line by line, like a breach in the dark.
